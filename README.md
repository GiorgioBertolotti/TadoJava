# TadoJava

TadoJava is a Java wrapper library for [Tado](https://www.tado.com/en/)'s API.  
It allows you to control your Tado and get its status.

## Getting started

To use TadoJava you will need:

- A Tado (lol);
- A Tado account ([You can create it here](https://my.tado.com/webapp/));
- A client secret ([You can get yours here](https://my.tado.com/webapp/env.js)).

## Use

The *Example* folder contains an eclipse project with an example on how to use the library.

### Notes

To build this project I followed [this guide](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/02/tado-api-guide-updated-for-2019/), which perfectly describes Tado's API. So I'd like to thanks [Terence Eden](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/) for his work!
